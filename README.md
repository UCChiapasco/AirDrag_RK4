# AirDrag_RK4
A fourth order Runge Kutta solver for realistic projectile motion simulation. This concise C++ solver allows for fast calculations of motion trajectories and can be easily rewritten to fit specific tasks in this context.
The file main.cpp contains the code, whereas AirDrag_RK4.pdf is a short paper (in italian) which resumes all the results and characteristics of the code.
